## Description 

RTE built an open-source data platform with partners to share energy consumption/production data in France. In this context, all the data helps build a forecast system of the energy consumption system in France (and different regions).

In this competition, the goal is to build a forecast pipeline to predict the energy consumption of the main metropolitan areas in France. the timestep of prediction is 15 minutes between the 1st of January 2022 to the 1st of May 2022.

This kind of application can be beneficial for companies that manage energy production and distribution and help optimize the trading of energy around countries.
